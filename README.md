# about-me
This site was created by Alissa Beddow, as a project for Alchemy Code Lab, Code 201.

This code would not be possible without help from the following, in alphabetical order: Sarah Joy Calpo, Johnny Luangphasy, Carmen Perezchica, Liz Peterson, Charly Welch, and Katlyn (not sure of her last name). Thanks, everyone!
