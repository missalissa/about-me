        <h1>Hi! I'm Alissa.</h1>
        <p>Thanks for checking out my page. Here's a little bit about me, and a few questions to offer some additional info and test your recollection.</p>
        <p>I grew up in Aberdeen, South Dakota, the pheasant capital of the world. I have one sister, and spent lots of summers on the Missouri River fishing with my Dad.</p>
        <p>After high school I moved to Minnesota, took a few courses at the local college, and waited tables. A few years later I moved to Portland and attended PSU, receiving a BA in Linguistics. I worked in nonprofit communications for eight+ years, and returned to school in 2009 to study Graphic Design at Mt. Hood Community College. I enjoy all things design, and continue to work with nonprofits and small businesses in a freelance capacity. I'm back in school to become a front-end developer.</p>
        <p>When not in front of a computer, I like to be outdoorsâ€”hiking, camping, or day-tripping with my partner. And here's a short list of some of my other favorite things:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Our cat, Jehu. And this <a href="https://www.catgifpage.com/" alt="all cat gifs, all the time">cat gif website</a>.</li>
            <li>Plants, plants, plants. Cannot have enough.</li>
            <li>Stormy weekends at the coast.</li>
        </ul>
